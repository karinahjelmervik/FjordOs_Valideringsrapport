\section{Observations}
\label{sec:obser}

Model simulations are performed for the period April 2014 through December 2015. Observations gathered independent of the FjordOs project, and available for this period, are shown by Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs}. They encompass water level, profiles of currents, hydrographic (temperature and salinity) profiles, and temperature at fixed stations. The measurements are scattered in time except for water level at Viker, Oscarsborg and Oslo and the current measurements at Slagen, which are gathered regularly in time and for a much longer period. Through the FjordOs project we have in addition made cruises in Breiangen to collect drifter trajectories.

\subsection{Water level}
\label{subsec:wlevelo}
The Norwegian Mapping Authority has three permanent stations measuring sea level in the Oslofjord (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs}), namely Viker, Oscarsborg and Oslo. As shown the station at Viker is located close to the open boundary of the model area, while Oscarsborg is located halfway into the Inner Oslofjord and the station at Oslo in the Oslo Harbour. The station at Viker is used to adjust the tidal input in accord with \cite{hjelm:etal:2017}.

\subsection{Currents}
\label{subsec:curreo}
%\subsubsection{Currents in two cross sections}
During the period mid September through late November 2014 six moorings, each fitted with an upward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Progiler (ADCP), were deployed as shown by Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs}, and detailed by Tab.~\ref{tab:Statnett}. Two of them were deployed at the stations named Filtvedt and Brenntangen at the entrance to the Dr{\o}bak Sound. The remaining four were deployed further south at the locations named Sm{\aa}skj{\ae}r, Laksetrappa, Botnegrunnen, and Evje. The latter four forms section across the fjord along a line with deep basins on either side (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs}). The six moorings were all deployed as a part of a project conducted by Statnett, NIVA, Akvaplan NIVA, and the University of Oslo (UiO). The R/V Trygve Braarud, UiO was used during deployment and recovery of the moorings. For further details about the applied moorings and corresponding instruments the reader is referred to \cite{staalstrom:2015}.

%%% (LPR: Moved to the Evaluation section) The strongest currents were found at the two northernmost stations at the entrance to the Dr{\o}bak Sound, namely Filtvedt and Brenntangen. Here the fjord is relatively narrow, and hence the somewhat stronger current may be explained by a stronger tidal signal due to the tapering of the width of the fjord at the entrance to the Dr{\o}bak Sound. We also note that the stations with the smallest depths exhibits the highest current velocities. This may be explained by the fact that the horizontal pressure gradient has a tendency to decrease with depth.

%At one station (Botnegrunnen) a single point current meter was deployed just below the profiling current meter.while the

Data from an additional bottom-mounted ADCP, named Slagen (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs}), and made available to us by Exxonmobil, Slagentangen, is also used for comparison with model results. It has measured currents regularly at two depths since 1997, and is located 50-80 meters northwest of Turning Dolphin at the Slagen Refinery (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-kart}). Note that Bliksekilen nature reserve, which is a shallow water area with rare flora and fauna, is located west of the Slagen Refinery.

\subsection{CTD measurements}
\label{subsec:CTDo}
On behalf of Fagr{\aa}det for Ytre Olsofjord NIVA collects CTD measurements at a number of selected positions in the Oslofjord. The work is part of a program monitoring the eutrophication state of the Outer Oslofjord and the Drammensfjord. The data collected are available through a web portal\footnote{http://www.aquamonitor.no/ytreoslofjord/}. We use data from ten of these as listed by Table ~\ref{tab:CTD_pos}. Their resepctive locations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_obs} as green triangles. The measurements include profiles of temperature and salinity as well as water quality parameters. During the simulation period April 2014 through December 2015 12 CTD profiles was available covering the months January, February, June, July, August, September, and November. No data are unfortunately available in spring and early summer.

We note that only a few of the CTD stations are located in the open part of the fjord. In fact seven of the ten stations are located inside narrow straits and sounds, or inside lesser subfjords or inlets. Of the remaining three stations only two are in the open parts of the fjord, namely Torbj{\o}rnskj{\ae}r (OF-1) and Breiangen (OF-5), while the last ({\O}-1) is positioned in a semi-open location west of the Hvaler Archipelago. The latter is interesting in that it is influenced by the fresh water discharged by the western branch of the river Glomma. In this resepct also the stations D-2 and D-3 are interesting being located inside the sill in the Drammensfjord in which the river Drammenselva discharges its fresh water.

%\subsubsection{Water temperature in the Inner Oslofjord}

In addition temperature measurements at three beaches in the Inner Oslofjord (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart_strand}), namely (from south to north) Sj{\o}strand, Hvalstrand and Stor{\o}yodden, which are performed in a cooperation between Asker and B{\ae}rum kommune, and Finnerud Elektronikk, is available to us. The measurement device is a digital thermometer (Maxim Integrated DS18B20) with an accuracy of $\pm 0.5^{\textrm{o}}$C. They measure water temperature at 40 cm beneath the surface in water depths of several meters. Temperatures are measured every three hours from 09:00 to 18:00 during the summer months. Again we note that the site Sj{\o}strand is the only one located in a semi-open position, while the two other beaches are well within archipelagoes that are somewhat sheltered from the rest of the fjord.

Finally one mooring at Filtvedt had TinyTag temperature loggers deployed at seven different depths between 20 and 120 m (rig Km2, Tab.~\ref{tab:Statnett})

The trends of the observed temperatures at the three beaches are similar, but the temperature is generally lower at the southern beach, Sj{\o}strand, than at the northern beach, Stor{\o}yodden (Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_strand}). In 2014 there were two local maximuma during July, and the maximum observed temperatures in 2014 were higher than in both 2013 and 2015. The temperature increases 1-3 degrees during the day and decreases during the night.

\subsection{Surface drifters}
\label{subsec:drifto}
As part of the FjordOs project two cruises in the Oslofjord were performed. During these cruises a total number of 15 surface drifters were released (Figure \ref{fig:drifters_design}). Two were released during a cruise in September 2014, and the remaining 13 was released in a cruise in September 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:drifters_tracks}). The second cruise is documented in \cite{hjelm:etal:2016}, which also describes the drifters used in detail. The focus area of the drifter campaigns is the Breiangen area, and the area between Horten and Moss.

\subsection{Godafoss oil spill}
\label{sect:godafoss_obs}
On Thursday the 17th of February 2011 at 19:52 local time, the containership Godafoss ran aground at the Kv{\ae}rnskj{\ae}rgrunnen rock in L{\o}peren, between the islands of Asmal{\o}y and Kirk{\o}y in Hvaler municipality in southeastern Norway (Figure \ref{fig:godafoss_oil}). One of the effects of this grounding was an acute release of oil from the ship, which drifted westward from the accident site. The oil slick has been observed from aeroplane by Kystverket, and the sites where stranded oil has been observed, are also registered (Figure \ref{fig:godafoss_oil}). This accident was on of the motivation factors for the project FjordOs, and hence, although no simulations are performed for this particular event, we will, nevertheless simulate trajectories from this location using the simulations performed for the period April 2015 through December 2015 (Section \ref{sec:evalu}). 

At the time of the grounding there were clear skies and temperatures around -3$^o$C. Observations of wind from Str{\o}mtangen lighthouse (15 km away from the grounding site) indicate 6-7 m/s winds from the north-east.
