    \caption{\small Displayed is the time it takes a Lagrangian particle to reach inside a given 140 x 140 m area after it is released based on a one year simulation. The location of the release is marked by a black solid circle, and corresponds to the location where Godafoss ran aground. The color bar indicates the time in hours. Left-hand panel shows the time up to and including 47.5 hours, while the right-hand panel shows the time up to and including 12 hrs and for a smaller domain.}
