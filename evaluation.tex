\subsection{Water level and tide}

Time series from the three permanent stations measuring water level have been analysed and compared with simulated time series of water level extracted from locations near the three permanent stations. Both simulated and observed time series of water level are analysed using t\_tide \citep{pavlo:etal:2002} in order to extract the tidal components. The same period in time is applied for both the simulations and the observations (April 2014 to December 2015).

\label{fig:Waterlevel_jan15} 
\end{figure} 

Eleven tidal components are included in the model at the southern open boundary using their corresponding amplitudes and phases for both depth integrated currents and water level \citep{roed:etal:2016}. The time series of tidal components included in the tidal forcing are in fairly good agreement (Fig.~\ref{fig:Waterlevel_jan15},upper, and Tab.\-\ref{tab:Tide}). In addition to the tidal components included in the tidal forcing, more tidal components are present in the time series (Fig.~\ref{fig:Waterlevel_tide}). Tidal components with periods of approximately one year (SA) and half a year (SSA) respectively are present in both the observations and the simulations (Tab.\-\ref{tab:Tide}). In addition, the observations have more components with shorter periods which are not included in the tidal forcing and thereby not present in the simulations. This is consistent with the frequency series of the Fourier transformed water level (Fig.~\ref{fig:Waterlevel_freq}).

The amplitude of M$_2$ increases from south to north in the Inner Oslofjord both in the simulations and the observations (Fig.~\ref{fig:M2field} and Tab.~\ref{tab:Tide}). The lowest M$_2$ amplitude in the area of interest, is in the Drammensfjord north of the threshold in Svelvik. The M$_2$ phase has a sudden increase at the thresholds of Svelvik and Dr{\o}bak (Fig.~\ref{fig:M2field}). The same yields for the majority of the other relevant tidal components.

\subsection{Currents}

\subsubsection{Currents in two cross sections}

Current measurements were performed in two cross sections. Here the model results are evaluated using the measurements at the northern cross section, Brenntangen-Filtvedt. The results are similar at the southern cross section.

The observed and simulated currents at Filtvedt and Brenntangen are of the same magnitude in strength, but the flow pattern differs. Figure~\ref{fig:Filtvedt-cur} shows the observed and simulated currents at Filtvedt as an example. The observed currents at Brenntagen is similar in strength, but the peaks in current strength do not occur at the same time. The observations are dominated by noise in the upper 35-40 meters. Only depths larger than 40 meters are therefore included in the comparison.

Note that the 3D current field is complex, the currents vary horizontally, vertically and with time. Figure~\ref{fig:Filtvedt-simcur} shows the simulated currents at three different depths. In general, the currents in the upper layer are stronger than further down. In the upper layers the currents are towards north, at 40 meters depth the currents towards south, and at 100 meters depth towards north. Because of the complex flow pattern, the currents at a given coordinates cannot be taken at representative for the whole area. At 100 meters depth the currents at Filtvedt are weak and towards south even though the currents at 100 meters depth is generally stronger and towards north. At 40 meters depth the currents at Brenntangen is weaker than in the rest of the cross section. Note that the depth at Brenntangen is only 58 meters in the observations while in the depth is 46 meters at the corresponding point in the simulations.

\end{figure}

The tides are evident in the observed and simulated currents at all observation points. Both simulated and observed time series of the currents at the seven observation points are analyzed using t\_tide \cite{pavlo:etal:2002} in order to extract the tidal components for each depth. The same period in time is applied for both simulations and observations (mid-September to the end of November 2014). Figure~\ref{fig:Filtvedt-tide} shows the tidal currents at Filtvedt. At Filtvedt the tidal impact in the observations occurs earlier at larger depths, but in the simulations the tidal impact occurs earlier at more shallow depths. This might be due to the flow pattern at the different depths and the fact that the flow pattern depends strongly on the bottom topography which is smoothed in the simulations. Note also that the calculations of the tides are based on only six weeks of data.

\label{fig:Slagen_QQ}
\end{figure}

Time series reveal that the observed velocities varies and follows no striking pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-tid}).
Current roses show that both the observed and the simulated velocities are stronger in the upper layer (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-rose}). The simulated velocities are stronger than the observed velocities. This is in accordance with the probability density functions (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-pdf}). The yearly maximum observed velocities are approximately 0.4 and 0.6 m/s at 10 and 2.5 meters depth respectively (Tab.~\ref{tab:Slagen_max}). During 2014 and 2015 maximum observed velocity at 2.5 meters depth was 0.55 m/s in southeast direction (143$^o$N) the 26th of March 2014. The velocity at 10 meters depth was 0.08 m/s (153$^o$N) at the time of maximum velocity at 2.5 meters depth indicating that the velocities are different in the two layers.

The mean directions are to the south east. At approximately 2.5 meters depth the mean directions are 146$^o$N and 139$^o$N for observed and simulated directions respectively which is in fairly good agreement. At approximately 10 meters depth the observed mean direction shifts to 170$^o$N while the simulated mean direction is 148$^o$N. 
Testing with popcorn indicate that the preferred direction of the surface currents are towards Bliksekilen located west of the Slagen Refinery. This is not the case neither in the observations nor the simulations.
The probability density functions reveals that the model captures the distribution of directions in the upper layer, but does not capture the change in direction between the two depths (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-pdf}). The standard deviations at 2.5 and 10 meters are 55 and 66 degrees respectively for the observed directions, and 56 and 61 for the simulated directions.

The time series scatter plots reveal that the correlation in time is not satisfying (Fig.~\ref{fig:Slagen-tid} and \ref{fig:Slagen_QQ}). The model seem to have difficulties with capturing the right phenomena influencing the currents to the right time. This is a well known problem when it comes to forecasting currents. The QQ-plots also confirms that the simulated currents are stronger than the observed currents.

\subsection{Hydrography}

\subsubsection{CTD-measurements}

Positions where CTD measurements are taken in the monitoring program for the Outer Oslofjord are listed in Table ~\ref{tab:CTD_pos}. 
Simulated temperature and salinity profiles at some of these stations are extracted from the model run. 
Comparison between simulated and observed profiles are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CTD_OF-1}-~\ref{fig:CTD_D-3}, for the stations OF-1 in the outer part of the fjord, LA-1 in Larvikfjord and D-2 inside the Svelvik Sill in the inner Drammensfjord. 

During the summer, the water in the upper layers are heated. 
The maximum surface temperature is observed towards the end of the summer. 
The profiles in the outer parts of the fjord indicate that the upper layer is too thin in the simulated data (Fig.~\ref{fig:CTD_OF-1}). 
At larger depths, the water is too cold and the salinity is too high. 
This might indicate that the open boundary input and the representation of vertical mixing should be modified. 

Some of the observations are taken from smaller fjord branches, such as in the Larviksfjord close to the open boundary in the outer part of the Oslofjord. 
In such shallow waters, observations reveal that the whole water column is heated during summer and cooled during winter, but the simulated temperature varies only in the upper 20 meters (Fig.~\ref{fig:CTD_OF-1}). 

The water masses below sill depth in the Drammensfjord are known to have very low vertical diffusivity leading to low oxygen conditions in the depth.
Fig.~\ref{fig:CTD_D-3} reveals that the vertical diffusivity in the same basin in the model is two high.
In the model water with low salinity is mixed down all the way to the bottom.

\label{fig:CTD_D-3}
\end{figure}

To get a better idea of how the properties of the water masses varies with time, contour plots of salinity and temperature are made as a function of depth and time.
Three of the stations in the monitoring program are chosen to describe how the salinity and temperature in different parts of the fjord system evolves through two seasons. Station D-3 outside Solumstrand in the inner Drammensfjord, station OF-5 in Breiangen and station OF-1 near Torbj{\o}rnskj{\ae}r close to the open boundary of the model domain, are chosen.

Observed salinity and temperature at the three chosen stations are shown in 
Figs.~\ref{fig:Salt_YO_2014_2015} and ~\ref{fig:Temp_YO_2014_2015} respectively. 
If the salinity of the stations OF-5 and OF-1 are compared (middle and lower panel in Fig. ~\ref{fig:Salt_YO_2014_2015}) it can be seen that the variations at for instance 40 m depth in Breiangen follow the variations further out in the fjord, but is approximately 1 psu fresher.
This indicate a relatively good water exchange in the outer part of the fjord system.
The water masses below sill depth in the Drammensjord is different. 
The salinity below 40 m depth is lower than at the same depth in Breiangen, and the salinity change very little with time.
These are clear signs of a stagnant water mass, and is expected given the shallow sill 
depth of only 12 m at Svelvik.   

The seasonal temperature changes in the surface layer is slowly diffused down in the water masses in the outer part of the fjord system (middle and lower panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:Temp_YO_2014_2015}).
The temperature at 100 m depth has a seasonal change, but the maximum value is shifted in time, so the highest temperatures are found in the start of January at this depth.
As seen in the upper panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:Temp_YO_2014_2015} the temperature variations 
in the surface layer in the Drammensfjord is prevented from penetrating further down than
about 40 m depth due to the low vertical diffusivity.

Fig.~\ref{fig:Salt_Mod_2014_2015} shows the salinity at the three chosen stations extracted from the model.
The water exchange in the model between the two stations OF-5 and OF-1 is relatively good, and the variations at OF-1 follow the variations further out in the fjord.
This was the same we saw from the observations.
The salinity however is to high at mid depth and this can as mentioned above be due to
wrong open boundary input or vertical diffusivity.
The upper panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:Salt_Mod_2014_2015} shows that the deep water masses in the Drammensfjord have a high salinity at model initialisation, but fresh water from the surface is quickly mixed down.   

Fig.~\ref{fig:Temp_Mod_2014_2015} shows the temperature at the three chosen stations extracted from the model.
When the modelled temperature evolution in the outer part of the fjord system is compared with the observations, the vertical mixing seems to be too low, and the heating of the surface water during summer do not penetrate deep enough during the winter.
While inside the Svelvik Sill the surface waters are mixed down too deep.

\subsubsection{Water temperature near \AA sg\aa rdstrand}

The temperature observations from Scanmar AS are compared with simulated data extracted from 1.15 meters depth at approximately the same location as the observations.

Time series reveal that the simulated and observed temperature are in fairly good agreement (Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_2015}). During winter and spring, but the model underestimate the temperature in the summer and fall with a few degrees  and \ref{fig:temp-QQ_scatter}). The model captures the timing of the daily variations in temperature, but seems to overestimate heating and cooling causing too large daily variations (Fig.~\ref{fig:temp_jun2015}). 

2014 had a warmer summer than 2015. This is evident in both the observations and the simulations (Tab.~\ref{tab:temp}). The summer months of 2014 also had the largest variance in both the observed and the simulated temperature during 2014 and 2015. Generally, the simulated monthly temperature had a larger variance than the observed monthly temperature. The mean of the observed and simulated temperatures are 10.0$^o$C and 8.6$^o$C respectively, while the variances are 27.2$^o$C and 21.1$^o$C respectively.

\subsubsection{Water temperature in the Inner Oslofjord}

The observed and simulated temperature at three beaches in the Inner Oslofjord are in relatively good agreement (Fig.~\ref{fig:badetemp_2014} - \ref{fig:badetemp_2015}). 

Close to the shoreline and only 40 cm under the surface, the temperature is heavily influenced by the weather situation and local circulation patterns. 

The temperature differences during the day are larger in the model than in the observations. The observed temperature increases 1-3 degrees from 09:00 to 18:00 and is not measured during the night, while the modelled temperature increases up to six degrees from 06:00 to 23:00. The fact that temperature is not measured during the night, but only from 09:00 to 18:00, might explain differences i temperature rise during the day, but the difference might indicate too much heating in the model.

%Since the temperature is observed close to the shoreline, some near river outlets, and only 40 cm under the surface, the temperature ise heavily influenced by the weather situation and local circulation patterns. The model is not expected to capture such detailed effects. Still there are similarities between the modelled and the observed temperatures both in temperature level and in fluctuations. 

During the summer 2014 the model predicts higher temperatures at Sj\o strand than was observed. The observations in Hvalstrand have some of the same trends as the modelled temperature with temperatures up to 25 degrees. The air temperatures in 2014 was higher than in 2015 and resulted in higher water temperatures, especially in shallow areas.

\subsection{Drifting lanes}
\subsubsection{Godafoss}
\label{sect:godafoss_model}
Since the time period of the model does not cover the time period when the container ship Godafoss ran aground, we have instead released drifters in our model from the position of the oil spill from Godafoss for a period of one year. We argue that over such a long period of time, there will be at least one weather and current situation similar to the weather and currents experienced during the Godafoss release. By showing the models ability to advect oil to the observed locations during a one year run, we at least show that our ocean model is capable of recreating the right drift patterns.

To simulate the drift of the oil, we have applied the open source trajectory-model OpenDrift. This is a trajectory model under development at MET Norway, and is described by its developers as "a software for modelling the trajectories and fate of objects or substances drifting in the ocean, or even in the atmosphere". It is distributed under a GPL v2.0 license, and is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/knutfrode/opendrift}.

The OpenDrift model was forced with currents from the FjordOs model and with wind from the Arome-MetCoOp 2.5km (Arome2.5) atmospheric model (the same atmospheric model was used as forcing when running the FjordOs hindcast). We have also provided daily mean currents from NorKyst-800m outside of the FjordOs-model, to properly treat the particles that are advected out of the FjordOs-model, so they can re-enter at the correct location. We can tune a number of parameters when running OpenDrift, e.g. random walk and the wind drift factor. Random walk was not used in our simulations of drifting lanes, and the wind drift factor was set to $0.01$ (i.e. $1\%$). Modelled drifters has been released once per hour from April 1st 2015 to April 1st 2016, a total number of 8760 particles. The lifetime of each particle is set to 15 days, i.e. after 15 days the particle is deactivated. This is done to reduce the computational cost of advecting a large number of particles. 

The results from the drift model can be viewed in Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_time} - \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}. In Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_time}, we show the number of hours from the particles were released until they reached different areas of the domain. Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_conc} show the likelihood of an area experiencing oil. This is done by counting the number of particles that has been inside each grid cell during the simulation, and presenting this as concentrations. Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos} depicts the same as the two previous figures, but only showing the values in the final position of each trajectory. This is to better visualise stranding sites. All these calculations are done on a $140m$ by $140m$ grid.

When comparing the results in Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_time} - \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos} to the observed oil in Figure \ref{fig:godafoss_oil}, we clearly see that there are some similarities between the observations and the simulations. Especially by looking at Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}, right panel, we can see that a substantial number of particles are transported westward from the release position at Hvaler, and strand along the Vestfold coast, the islands around Tj{\o}me, and the F{\ae}rder lighthouse. We would also like to point out the very low number of particles that strand at the peninsula west of Stavern (the area far left in Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}). This corresponds well with where the oil was observed.
In the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}, we provide the shortest time from the release of particles, to stranding. We would like to point out two areas: Stavern (western part of Figure 
\ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}) and Bustein (northwest of the F{\ae}rder lighthouse). In Figure \ref{fig:godafoss_oil}, the oil at Bustein was discovered two days after the initial spill, while at Stavern (Korntin) the oil was observed after five days. This corresponds well with the timing in Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_godafoss_endpos}.

\subsubsection{Surface drifters}
We evaluate the models ability to recreate the drifter trajectories by using a skill-score, as described in \cite{liu:2011}: 

$$s=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i / \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} l_{oi}$$

\[ ss = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 - \frac{s}{n}   & \quad (s \leq n)\\
    1                & \quad (s > n)   \\ 
  \end{cases}
\]
where $n$ is a tolerance threshold, $d_i$ is the separation distance between the modelled and observed endpoints of the Lagrangian trajectories at time step $i$ after the initialisation (virtual particle release), $l_{oi}$ is length of the observed trajectory, and $N$ is the total number of time steps.

A skill-score of 1 means a perfect match, while a score of 0 means no skill. %We have used a tolerance treshold $n=1$.
The skill-score for each drifter compared to trajectories from OpenDrift based on both the FjordOs and NorKyst-800m models is given in Table \ref{tab:skillscore_full}, \ref{tab:skillscore_1hr}, \ref{tab:skillscore2014_1h}, and \ref{tab:skillscore2014_24h}. For simulated trajectories during the September 2015 cruise (Table \ref{tab:skillscore_full} and \ref{tab:skillscore_1hr}), both currents and wind drift has been applied, while for the trajectories of September 2014 (Table \ref{tab:skillscore2014_1h} and \ref{tab:skillscore2014_24h}) only currents have been applied to produce the trajectories.

Examination of the values for skill-score, and visual inspection of the trajectories themselves, do not provide a clear conclusion on which ocean model performs better. During the September 2014 release, the FjordOs model performs better that the NorKyst-800m, but there is a clear weakness here since we do not have hourly data from NorKyst-800m available. Also, there are only two drifters. The FjordOs model has the highest skill-score based on both hourly and daily average data, and was the only model to transport the drifters as far south as the observed drift. Based on this, we think it is safe to conclude that the FjordOs model had an overall current situation that was close to the real situation. The currents in NorKyst-800m is believed to be too weak during this drifter release.

During the September 2015 cruise we released 10 drifters. The NorKyst-800m model has an overall higher skill-score than FjordOs when we take into account the entire trajectory, and  also when we only consider the first hour of the trajectory. When we do the visual comparison between the trajectories in Figure \ref{fig:opendrift_trajectories1} - \ref{fig:opendrift_trajectories3}, it is very tempting to point out that the trajectories based on the FjordOs model more often compares well to the observed trajectory than what the one based on NorKyst-800m does, but we will leave this up to the reader to decide.
