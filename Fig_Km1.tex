	\caption{\small Observations (upper panel) and model results (lower panel) from station Km1 (FB transect). The colorbar indicates the current speed in m/s along the channel. Red colors indicate flow into the fjord, while blue colors indicate flow out of the fjord. The black contourline shows where the current speed is zero. Note that the shallowest observations is at 16 m depth, which is indicated by a straight horisontal line in the lower panel.}
