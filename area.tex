\section{Area of interest}

The area of interest is the Oslofjord including the Drammensfjord and the Inner Oslofjord (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart}). The Oslofjord is located in Southern Norway with the capital of Norway, Oslo, in the innermost part of the fjord. 
The fjord is about 100 km long. Around 59.56$^o$N the fjord splits into two branches, the Inner Oslofjord (eastern branch) and the Drammensfjord (western branch). The width varies from around 25 km at the entrance to about 1-2 km at Dr\o bak Sound in the Inner Oslofjord and 180 meters at Svelvik in the Drammensfjord.

Numerous smaller and larger islands combined with deeper and shallower basins (Fig.~\ref{fig:kart}) contributes to a complex circulation pattern. In addition several river discharge fresh water into the fjord, including two of Norway's largest rivers, namely Glomma (near Fredrikstad) and Drammenselva (near Drammen).
