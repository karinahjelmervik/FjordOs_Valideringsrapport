	\caption{\small Observed (upper panel) and simulated (lower panel) mean currents from station Km1 (FB transect). The mean current is estimated by taking a running mean of 49 hours. The colorbar indicates the current speed in m/s along the channel. Red colors indicate flow into the fjord, while blue colors indicate flow out of the fjord. The black contourline shows where the mean flow is zero. The shallowest observations is at 16 m depth. This depth is indicated in the lower panel with a horizontal line.}
