	\caption{\small A snapshot of the simulated current speed across the two transect Filtvedt and Brenntangen (upper panel) and Sm{\aa}skj{\ae}r-Evje (bottom panel). The location of the transects are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kart_obs}. The bathymetry of the model is drawn with a thick black line, while the real bathymetry is drawn with a thin grey line. The simulated along fjord current speed in m/s, valid at October 24, 2014 at 12:00 UTC, is indicated by the colorbar. Here red colors indicate currents into the fjord, while blue colors indicate currents out of the fjord. A thin black line indicates where the current speed is zero. The white vertical lines indicate the position where model results are extracted for compariosn with the observations at the stations listed by Table~\ref{tab:Statnett}.}
